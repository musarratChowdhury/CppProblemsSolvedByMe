// There are n applicants and m free apartments. Your task is to distribute the apartments so that as many applicants as possible will get an apartment.
// Each applicant has a desired apartment size, and they will accept any apartment whose size is close enough to the desired size.
// Input
// The first input line has three integers n, m, and k: the number of applicants, the number of apartments, and the maximum allowed difference.
// The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n: the desired apartment size of each applicant. If the desired size of an applicant is x, he or she will accept any apartment whose size is between x-k and x+k.
// The last line contains m integers b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m: the size of each apartment.
// Output
// Print one integer: the number of applicants who will get an apartment.
// Constraints
//
// 1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^5
// 0 \le k \le 10^9
// 1 \le a_i, b_i \le 10^9
//
// Example
// Input:
// 4 3 5
// 60 45 80 60
// 30 60 75
//
// Output:
// 2
